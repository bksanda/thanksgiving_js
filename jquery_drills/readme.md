#jQuery Drills

This repository contains 5 challenges to help solidify what you've learned in jQuery so far. Each of the html files included in this repository contains instructions.

All problems can be solved by editing the .js files in the /js/ folder. You do not need to edit the stylesheets or html to solve any of these problems, but if you want to get creative after you solve the original problems feel free. However, be aware that all 5 pages use the same styles.css so any modifications will be reflected on all 5 pages and could have unforeseen consequences.


When in doubt use the [jQuery Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/).
